# 🔐 Login Bruteforce Simulator (Ethical)

An educational Python-based login brute-force simulator designed for cybersecurity learning.
This tool simulates brute-force attacks on a demo login system — NOT real websites.

## 🚀 Features
- Username & password wordlist support
- Delay & rate-limit simulation
- Colored terminal output
- Stops when valid credentials are found
- Logs all attempts to file
- Beginner to intermediate friendly
