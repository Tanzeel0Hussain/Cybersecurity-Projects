# 🛡️ Vulnerability Scanner (Web Security Audit Tool)

An advanced Python-based vulnerability scanner designed to identify common web security
misconfigurations and weaknesses.

This tool focuses on **detection**, not exploitation.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Can Do
- Scan for missing HTTP security headers
- Detect exposed directories and files
- Identify server information leakage
- Detect insecure web configurations
- Generate a detailed vulnerability report
- Color-coded terminal output

## 🧠 Why This Project Is ADVANCED
✔ Uses real web security standards  
✔ Focuses on vulnerability detection (Blue Team)  
✔ Applies OWASP Top 10 concepts  
✔ Real-world penetration testing logic  
✔ More advanced than scanners that only scan ports  

This project shows understanding of **web application security**, not just networking.
